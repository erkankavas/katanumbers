# XCTest Xcode Project KataNumbers

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of XCTest in Xcode to perform unit testing on various numerical operations. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to integrate robust testing practices in their iOS applications. By focusing on numbers, this sample project highlights common scenarios where precise calculations and validations are critical.

## Features
Basic Arithmetic Tests: Verify the accuracy of basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Boundary Value Analysis: Ensure that numerical operations handle boundary values correctly, including testing with very large and very small numbers. (soon)

Edge Case Handling: Test edge cases such as division by zero, integer overflows, and floating-point precision issues. (soon)

Performance Testing: Measure the performance of complex numerical computations to ensure they meet the desired benchmarks. (soon)

Parameterized Testing: Use parameterized tests to validate numerical operations across a wide range of input values efficiently. (soon)

Error Handling: Verify that the application handles erroneous inputs gracefully and provides meaningful error messages. (soon)
